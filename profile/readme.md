We are HMGCC, His Majesty’s Government Communications Centre, the engineering specialists at the heart of the UK's national security.

You might notice there aren’t any of our own repositories here. Our engineers have access to GitHub to enable use of Copilot and, most importantly, to contribute to the vital world of open source software. 

Our GitHub profiles don’t contain any personally identifying information – because we work with the national security community, we protect the identities of our staff.

HMGCC follows a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Security Policy](https://github.com/mi6/ic-design-system/blob/main/SECURITY.md) and [Privacy Policy](https://design.sis.gov.uk/icds/privacy-policy).
