We are HMGCC, His Majesty’s Government Communications Centre, the engineering specialists at the heart of the UK's national security.

You might notice there aren’t any repositories here! 
Our engineers have access to GitHub to enable access to Copilot and, most importantly, to contribute to the vital world of open source software. 

Our GitHub profiles don’t contain any personally identifying information – because we work with the national security community, we protect the identities of our staff.
